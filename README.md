# CoffeeShop

This is my second C# project. I created this by following 'Controlling Program Flow in C#' tutorial on the Pluralsight platform.<br>
I learned how to apply the knowledge I had previosly learned in JavaScript for how to work with statements, branch program flow with selection statements, loop through tasks using iteration statements, and explore additional program flow and statement features.<br>
The program started off as the stock standard 'Hello World' program, then helped me build upon my C# knowledge starting hardcoded C# data files and then taught me how to refactor it so it would read JSON data files and produce an output.<br>
The next task I would like to try of my own volition is to break up the Main program into seperate services.
